# Modelling of Battery Management System for Electric Vehicles

Abstract - The battery system is affected by several factors, including cell imbalance. Without a balancing system, battery capacity and life quickly decrease over time. This will cause the entire battery system to fail. Thus, cell balancing has an important role in preserving battery life and performance. This report is presented various cell balancing methodologies and particularly, a comparison of passive cell balancing in detail. The cell balancer modelling of passive cell balancing technique with three serially connected cells is presented based on MATLAB/Simulink. Since three passive cell balancing circuits are compared and the algorithm and the switch have different efficiencies such as time and error values, the algorithm and the switch thus affect the efficiency of the passive cell balancing circuit. In addition, a study on cooling systems and coolants is proposed to reduce the efficiency of BMS, which is the limitation of passive cell balancing.
